# Ansible-Homelab

This is the repository I use to manage the services that I run in my homelab. It's small for now, but will hopefully grow in the future!

The repository is a set of Ansible `playbooks` that are used to deploy docker services from my [Dockerfile repo](https://github.com/Banshee1221/docker-homelab) (these might get merged in the future).

I figured I'd share!
